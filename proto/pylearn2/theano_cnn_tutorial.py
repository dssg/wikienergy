# A few words on ``dimshuffle`` :
#   ``dimshuffle`` is a powerful tool in reshaping a tensor;
#   what it allows you to do is to shuffle dimension around
#   but also to insert new ones along which the tensor will be
#   broadcastable;
#   dimshuffle('x', 2, 'x', 0, 1)
#   This will work on 3d tensors with no broadcastable
#   dimensions. The first dimension will be broadcastable,
#   then we will have the third dimension of the input tensor as
#   the second of the resulting tensor, etc. If the tensor has
#   shape (20, 30, 40), the resulting tensor will have dimensions
#   (1, 40, 1, 20, 30). (AxBxC tensor is mapped to 1xCx1xAxB tensor)
#   More examples:
#    dimshuffle('x') -> make a 0d (scalar) into a 1d vector
#    dimshuffle(0, 1) -> identity
#    dimshuffle(1, 0) -> inverts the first and second dimensions
#    dimshuffle('x', 0) -> make a row out of a 1d vector (N to 1xN)
#    dimshuffle(0, 'x') -> make a column out of a 1d vector (N to Nx1)
#    dimshuffle(2, 0, 1) -> AxBxC to CxAxB
#    dimshuffle(0, 'x', 1) -> AxB to Ax1xB
#    dimshuffle(1, 'x', 0) -> AxB to Bx1xA
output = T.nnet.sigmoid(conv_out + b.dimshuffle('x', 0, 'x', 'x'))
