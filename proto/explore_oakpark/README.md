Notebooks for getting statistics from Oak Park 
such as average consumption. 

generate_graphs generates average consumption by 
month and year

generate_graphs_from_pickle does the same thing as
generate_graphs but uses pickled data and goes a lot 
faster

get_files loads files from aws using an ssh client
